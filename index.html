            <h2>Hello.</h2>
            <p>I began my professional path in Training & Development back in 2010,
                I realized how <strong>"Education"</strong> is an amazing vehicle for transformation, so I decided to
                join a program named "Teach for Mexico" where I learned all about pedagogy & classroom leadership.
                <br> <br>
                Later I worked at a non-profit named Wadhwani Foundation where I became the Head of Training For Latin America,
                this role represented a huge challenge but also, an amazing experience; I learned about program management, Entrepreneurship,
                online content creation and Technology; it was also during this time where I <u>re-discover</u> my passion for Technology and realized
                its importance when it comes for for solving people´s problems or even communities issues. As I always say: <em>I believe that we need to put
                    our skills & effort in helping people to reach a better tomorrow</em>.
